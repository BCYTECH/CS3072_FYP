## Improving Email Productivity using Automation and Pattern Recognition ##
TLDR; Email is one of the main source of communication amongst businesses. However, we "users" are spending more time each day to read and write emails hence decreasing work productivity.
To increase productivity, we will be making a simple dashboard that helps triage email and allow users to review their emails in a simpler fashion rather than the norm, such as looking it from First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In First Out (LIFO).

### Implementation ###
Created with React (Front-End), NodeJS (Back-End) and Google Firebase (Database).
Utilised several open source library including Material UI and Nivo Pie.
